## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm an amazing teenager who is good at and finds coding fun...

Currently working on:
- An immaculate multi-dimensional world map simulation game where players govern their country to world domination while navigating moral dilemmas that warp reality to claim every last pixel of a massive intercontinental world called [Conqorial](https://github.com/agokule/Conqorial)
- Wielding spells of keybindings that bend syntax to my will in order to fight a war against the void of unstructured code while appeasing the gods of linters, autocompletion, and theme aesthetics all under the watchful eye of a sentient editor.
- Becoming CEO of Inc Inc Intl
