# Hi, I'm Atharv! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I'm an amazing teenager who is good at and finds coding fun...

Currently working on:
- An endless amount of schoolwork given to me by being in full IB
- Wielding spells of keybindings that bend syntax to my will in order to fight a war against the void of unstructured code while appeasing the gods of linters, autocompletion, and theme aesthetics all under the watchful eye of a sentient editor.
- Becoming CEO of Inc Inc Intl

## Languages I use (ever since late November 2024)
